# text-app-flooder

only made for linux and i dont intend to change that
use at your own risk. i will not be held accountable for anything
# compilation
1 dependencies:
xdotools /n
2 compiling:
compile with make <make flood> or g++ <g++ flood.cpp>(in case of using g++ run the a.out first with <./a.out>
ur using linux so i think you should be able to compile and troubleshoot without help
